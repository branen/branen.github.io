<strong>NAME</strong>
       panflute - metadata-driven runner for Panflute filters

<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
       <strong>panflute</strong> [<em>writer</em>]

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
       <strong>panflute</strong>  runs filters written for Panflute, a Pythonic API for transforming documents with Pan-
       doc.  It takes its options from the document metadata.

   <strong>Arguments</strong>
       <em>writer</em> Pandoc writer option (passed to filters).

   <strong>Document</strong> <strong>metadata</strong>
       <strong>panflute-path</strong>
              A list of directories to search for filters.

       <strong>panflute-filters</strong>
              A list of filters to run.  They may be specified as relative  or  absolute  paths  or  as
              Python module names.

       In either case, if a string is specified instead of a list, it will be treated as the single el-
       ement of an implicit list.

       See the Panflute library documentation for details.

<strong>SEARCH</strong> <strong>PATH</strong>
       The search for filters proceeds as follows:

       • The current directory is searched.

       • Each element of panflute-path is tilde– and environment-variable–expanded and searched in  or-
         der.

         In  addition to directory paths, the <strong>panflute-path</strong> list may also contain the values <strong>--data-dir</strong>
         or <strong>--no-sys-path</strong>; these change later search behavior.

       • If <strong>--data-dir</strong> was specified, the “<em>pandoc</em><strong>_</strong><em>user</em><strong>_</strong><em>dir</em>/filters” directory is searched,  where  <em>pan-</em>
         <em>doc</em><strong>_</strong><em>user</em><strong>_</strong><em>dir</em> is the default user data directory as reported by <strong>pandoc</strong> <strong>--version</strong>.

       • Unless <strong>--no-sys-path</strong> was specified, each element of Python's <strong>sys.path</strong> is searched in order.

<strong>EXAMPLE</strong>
              cat some_markdown.md | \
                  pandoc -f markdown -t html --filter panfl &gt;some_html.html
