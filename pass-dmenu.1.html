<strong>NAME</strong>
       pass-dmenu - an ergonomic UI for Password Store

<strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>
       <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> {clip, type} [<em>dmenu</em> <em>args</em>]...

<strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
       <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> is a <strong>dmenu</strong>-based UI for <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Store</strong> that uses predictive ordering and integrations
       with <strong>xdotool</strong> and <strong>pass-otp</strong> to reduce considerably the number of  keystrokes  required  to  use  a
       password.

       It is especially effective where sets of related passwords tend to be addressed in sequence.

   <strong>Actions</strong>
       The first argument to <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> must be the action to be performed with the selected password:

       <strong>clip</strong>   Copy the selected password to the clipboard (using <strong>xclip</strong>).

       <strong>type</strong>   “Type” the selected password (using <strong>xdotool</strong>).

       (<em>pass-dmenu</em> <em>clip</em> clears the clipboard after one paste or $PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME seconds.)

   <strong>Additional</strong> <strong>arguments</strong>
       Any additional arguments to <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> are passed directly to <strong>dmenu</strong>.

   <strong>One-time</strong> <strong>password</strong> <strong>support</strong>
       If  a  password value begins with otpauth://, <strong>pass-otp</strong> will be used to generate a one-time pass-
       word, which will then be <em>clipped</em> or <em>typed</em> as usual.

<strong>PREDICTIVE</strong> <strong>ORDERING</strong>
       <strong>dmenu</strong> provides two mechanisms by which to select an element from a list of  options:  filtration
       (based on substring match) and sequential navigation.  Because <strong>dmenu</strong>’s sequential navigation al-
       ways starts with the first filtered element, elements near the head of the list tend to  require
       fewer keystrokes to select than elements elsewhere in the list.  Thus, if we promote to the head
       of the list the elements that are likeliest to be selected in a given invocation, we can  reduce
       the number of keystrokes required to select them.

       <strong>pass-dmenu</strong>  begins with a list of password names in lexicographic order and performs this promo-
       tion using:

       • a set of manually defined, regex-based rules and

       • the password name selected in the most recent [prior] <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> invocation.

   <strong>Rulesets</strong>
       Rules for a password store are defined in the file .pass-dmenu.rules at the root of the password
       store.   This  ruleset is a JSON-encoded list of rules, where each rule is a single-element dic-
       tionary mapping a regular expression to a list of regular expression templates.   (Specifically,
       these are <strong>Python</strong> <strong>regular</strong> <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> <strong>format</strong> <strong>string</strong> <strong>templates</strong>.)

       For convenience, single-element template lists can be abbreviated by their element.

       In short, the schema is:

              RuleSet: List[
                  SingleElementDict[
                      MatcherRegex,
                      Union[PickerRegexTemplate, List[PickerRegexTemplate]]
                  ]
              ]

       Roughly,  each  rule maps from “what was selected most recently” to “what is likeliest to be se-
       lected next.”

   <strong>Evaluation</strong>
       Each <em>MatcherRegex</em> is evaluated against  the  most-recently-used  password  name  (or  the  empty
       string,  if  there is no most-recently-used password).  When there’s a hit, the resulting <em>Match-</em>
       <em>Group</em> is interpolated into each <em>PickerRegexTemplate</em>, resulting in a <em>PickerRegex</em>.  (Regex control
       characters appearing in the <em>MatchGroup</em> are escaped as necessary.)

              Match: fn[MostRecentlyUsedPasswordName, MatcherRegex] -&gt; Optional[MatchGroup]
              Interpolate: fn[MatchGroup, PickerRegexTemplate] -&gt; PickerRegex

       This  process  is applied to each rule in the ruleset, ultimately resulting in a list of <em>Picker-</em>
       <em>Regex</em> objects, ordered as they appear in the original JSON document:

              Evaluate: fn[RuleSet, MostRecentlyUsedPasswordName] -&gt; List[PickerRegex]

   <strong>Promotion</strong>
       Once the evaluation process is complete, <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> initializes two lists:

       • a <em>residual</em> list is initialized with all the names in the password store, sorted  lexicographi-
         cally, and

       • a <em>promoted</em> list is initialized with no elements.

       Starting  with  the  first  <em>PickerRegex</em>, <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> considers each element in the residual list,
       from head to tail.  Each time it encounters an element that  matches  the  current  <em>PickerRegex</em>,
       that  element  is moved from its position in the residual list to the tail of the promoted list.
       This process repeats for each <em>PickerRegex</em>.  Once it is complete, any elements that remain in the
       residual list are moved in order to the promoted list, and the promoted list is displayed to the
       user.

              Promote: fn[List[PickerRegex], List[PasswordNames]] -&gt; List[PasswordNames]

   <strong>Example</strong>
       Consider the following ruleset:

              [
                  {
                      "^(?P&lt;base&gt;.*)/(user|login)$": "^{base}/pass$"
                  },
                  {
                      "^(.*)/pass$": [
                          "^{1}/(otp|OTP)$",
                          "^{1}/(pin|PIN)$",
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "": [
                          "/user$",
                          "/login$",
                      ]
                  }
              ]

       ...and the following lexicographically-ordered list of password names:

              aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
              graceful.host/pass
              graceful.host/user
              grapefruit.home/email
              grapefruit.home/pass
              grapefruit.home/pin
              grapefruit.home/user
              horse.lan/login
              horse.lan/otp
              horse.lan/user
              pizza.corp/user

   <strong>First</strong> <strong>invocation</strong>
       If <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> is invoked without a most-recently-used password name (i.e. upon first  invocation
       or after cancelling an invocation), the ruleset will evaluate to these <em>PickerRegex</em> expressions:

              /user$
              /login$

       These expressions first promote everything ending in “/user”, and then promote everything ending
       in “/login”, resulting in the following final order:

              graceful.host/user
              grapefruit.home/user
              horse.lan/user
              pizza.corp/user
              horse.lan/login
              aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
              graceful.host/pass
              grapefruit.home/email
              grapefruit.home/pass
              grapefruit.home/pin
              horse.lan/otp

       Where the tersest way to select grapefruit.home/user would have been pe&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;En-
       ter&gt; in the original order, it is now p&lt;Enter&gt;.

   <strong>Second</strong> <strong>invocation</strong>
       If the user selects grapefruit.home/user and invokes <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> again, the ruleset will evaluate
       to these <em>PickerRegex</em> expressions:

              ^grapefruit\\.home/pass$
              /user$
              /login$

       This results in the following final order:

              grapefruit.home/pass
              graceful.host/user
              grapefruit.home/user
              horse.lan/user
              pizza.corp/user
              horse.lan/login
              aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
              graceful.host/pass
              grapefruit.home/email
              grapefruit.home/pin
              horse.lan/otp

       Where the tersest way to select grapefruit.home/pass would have been pe&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;, it is now
       &lt;Enter&gt;.

   <strong>Third</strong> <strong>invocation</strong>
       If the user selects grapefruit.home/pass and invokes <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> again, the ruleset will evaluate
       to these <em>PickerRegex</em> expressions:

              ^grapefruit\\.home/(otp|OTP)$
              ^grapefruit\\.home/(pin|PIN)$
              /user$
              /login$

       This results in the following final order:

              grapefruit.home/pin
              graceful.host/user
              grapefruit.home/user
              horse.lan/user
              pizza.corp/user
              horse.lan/login
              aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
              graceful.host/pass
              grapefruit.home/email
              grapefruit.home/pass
              horse.lan/otp

       Where the tersest way to select grapefruit.home/pass would have been pe&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;, it
       is now &lt;Enter&gt;.

   <strong>Fourth</strong> <strong>invocation</strong>
       If the user selects grapefruit.home/pass and invokes <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> again, the ruleset will evaluate
       to these <em>PickerRegex</em> expressions:

              /user$
              /login$

       And we’re now back to the same order that we saw on the initial invocation.

<strong>ENVIRONMENT</strong>
       <strong>PASSWORD_STORE_DIR</strong>
              The path of the password store directory.  Defaults to ~/.password-store.

       <strong>PASSWORD_STORE_UMASK</strong>
              The umask used by <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> when updating .pass-dmenu.rules.  Defaults to 077.

       <strong>PASSWORD_STORE_DMENU</strong>
              The path to <strong>dmenu</strong> (or equivalent).  Defaults to dmenu.

       <strong>PASSWORD_STORE_X_SELECTION</strong>
              The X selection to use for the clip action.  Defaults to clipboard.   (See  xclip(1)  for
              more information.)

       <strong>PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME</strong>
              The  number  of seconds the clip action should allot for the password to be pasted by the
              user before it gives up and clears the clipboard.  Defaults to 45.

<strong>FILES</strong>
       <strong>$PASSWORD_STORE_DIR/.pass-dmenu.rules</strong>
              The JSON ruleset for $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR.

       <strong>$PASSWORD_STORE_DIR/.pass-dmenu.cache</strong>
              The password most recently selected by <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> for  $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR.   (This  file
              will  be  zero-length  if the most recent <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> invocation was cancelled without se-
              lecting a password.)

<strong>SECURITY</strong> <strong>CONSIDERATIONS</strong>
       This section describes the security delta between using <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> and using <strong>Password</strong>  <strong>Store</strong>  on
       its own; it is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment.

   <strong>Cache</strong> <strong>file</strong>
       Each   time   a   password   is   selected   (or   a  password  selection  is  aborted),  $PASS-
       WORD_STORE_DIR/.pass-dmenu.cache will be updated atomically using rename(2) with the name of the
       most-recently-used   password   (or  emptiness).   An  adversary  with  read  access  to  $PASS-
       WORD_STORE_DIR could learn when you last  used  <strong>pass-dmenu</strong>  by  observing  the  change  time  of
       .pass-dmenu.cache,  and  they  could learn which password you chose (or that you didn’t choose a
       password) during that invocation by observing the contents of said file.  All of  this  informa-
       tion  (and  more)  could  also  be  learned  by  observing  the  access times of files in $PASS-
       WORD_STORE_DIR.

       By default, <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Store</strong> and <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> use a umask of 077, which prevents  users  other  than
       the  owner  of  $PASSWORD_STORE_DIR  from  observing both .pass-dmenu.cache and filesystem time-
       stamps.

       For additional confidentiality, <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> may be used with disk or file encryption schemes.

   <strong>Trusted</strong> <strong>base</strong>
       <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> is written in Python 3, using only built-ins and the standard  library.   Thus,  when
       you  trust  <strong>pass-dmenu</strong>  with your cleartext passwords, you extend the same trust to the Python 3
       interpreter, to portions of the Python 3 standard library, and to their dependencies.

   <strong>Swap</strong>
       In Python 3, as with most other languages in which memory management  is  implicit,  there’s  no
       great way to keep process state from being swapped to disk during periods when memory is scarce.
       As a result, cleartext passwords being handled by <strong>pass-dmenu</strong> could potentially wind up in a swap
       partition.   <em>This</em>  <em>issue</em> <em>is</em> <em>not</em> <em>unique</em> <em>to</em> <em>this</em> <em>software</em>—it also affects <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Store</strong> (which is
       written in bash), <strong>xclip</strong> and <strong>xdotool</strong> (which are written in C), and many applications that consume
       passwords (e.g. web browsers).

       The issue may be mitigated by disabling swap or by using an encrypted swap partition.

   <strong>Clipboard</strong>
       <em>pass-dmenu</em>  <em>clip</em>  allows  a  password  to  be  pasted  no more than once before the clipboard is
       cleared.  This is in contrast to <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Store</strong>, which does not clear the clipboard until $PASS-
       WORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME seconds have elapsed.

       <strong>Password</strong> <strong>Store</strong> attempts to clear password history from klipper, a clipboard manager.  <em>pass-dmenu</em>
       <em>clip</em> does not attempt to integrate with any clipboard managers.

       <em>pass-dmenu</em> <em>type</em> does not interact with the clipboard.
